# Rover-Coin-Game
 
Rover Coin Dash is a fast paced game where the player drives the rover in order to collect coins in each level. The goal is to unlock and beat all 10 levels by reaching the target score in each level. In addition, the player can try to complete each level as fast as possible and see if it can beat other previous times. 

Rover Coin Dash is programmed completely in C. It features a joystick, a STT7735 display, a 25LC080 EEPROM, and a STM32 microcontroller. The display is controlled by a display driver which was written by me. The EEPROM stores the highest level unlocked and the best times for each level.
